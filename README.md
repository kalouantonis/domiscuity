Parse html5 and play with the DOM with a clean API.

Supports clojure, clojurescript support is still experimental.

## Usage

```clojure
(ns my.app
 (:require [domiscuity.parser :as parser]
           [domiscuity.dom :as dom]))

;; Parse HTML file
(def doc (parser/doc (slurp "my-file.html")))

;; Fetch all elements with class "small"
(dom/find-by-class doc :small)

;; Fetch all elements with attribute "value"
(dom/find-by-attr doc :value)
;; Fetch all elements with attribute "value" of 5
(dom/find-by-attr doc :value 5)

;; Get a single element with ID main-container
(def elem (dom/find-by-id doc :main-container))

;; Get all attributes
(dom/attrs elem)
;; Set attribute value
(dom/set-attr! elem :class "top-level")
;; Get the new attribute
(println (dom/attr elem :class)) => "top-level"

;; Get all children of the given element
;; (includes text and comments)
(dom/children elem)

;; Get all ONLY element children
(dom/child-elems elem)

;; Add a child element
(dom/append! elem (dom/make-element "div" {:class "row"}))

;; Detach children from parents
(dom/detach! elem)

;; Add a sibling element to the current one
(dom/insert-after! elem (dom/make-element "div" {:id "footer"}))
;; Check that the sibling is correct
(println (dom/attr (dom/next-sibling elem) "id")) => "footer"

;; Transucer for finding javascript elements
(def xform (filter #(= "text/javascript" (dom/attr % "type"))))
;; Find all javascript script tags
(def javascripts (dom/find-by-tag "script" xform))

;; Perform advanced queries
(dom/query-all doc "p.small#introduction")
;; Filter with custom predicate
(dom/find-attr doc #(and (= (dom/attr % :class) "small")
                         (= (dom/attr % :id) "introduction")))
                         
;; Reading and writing text
(def doc (parser/doc "<p>My text block</p>"))
(println (dom/text doc)) => "My text block"
(dom/set-text! doc "Another text block")
(println (dom/text doc)) => "Another text block"
```
